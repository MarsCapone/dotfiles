# Marscapone's Dotfiles

These dotfiles, configured with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) get my terminal up and running from scratch.

Every time I setup a new machine, I run this so I can have the same config everywhere.
Occasionally I do some work to make the install more seemless. Sometimes this is successful, sometimes it isn't. 

## Getting Started

1. Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
2. Install chezmoi: `brew install chezmoi`
3. Apply this repo:

```
chezmoi init --apply MarsCapone
```
